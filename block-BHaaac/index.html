<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>It is December 19 - 5 days until Christmas! I'm quite excited and rather relieved as well. All is right with the world: the fire is roaring in the fireplace, my family and friends are safe and sound, my dog lies sleeping on her bed, and I am quite cozy with a cup of tea beside me.</p>
